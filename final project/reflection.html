        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>I did pretty well on this course. I also had fun trying codings and drawing things.</p>
        <p>the 3 topics I learned about and/or enjoyed are:<ul>
            <li>
                minecraft education stuff - The structures were very complex 
                and yet simple to understand. While doing stuff in the 2nd semester, 
                I saw Richard Pang and Calvin Purdy having a blast with coding and 
                playing around in minecraft (summoning a bunch of projectiles and a 
                lot of entities, watching bees slay a wither, making a very hard obby map, etc).
                I myself also tried making an RPG in this game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ubuntu & vs code & painting 
                & drawing tools in this classroom - They were crucial to my works this semester; 
                I never would have even started to make my own html website without them.
            </li>
            <li>
                html & css - I started making my websites with these languages. They
                are like the base foundations for my new websites, where I finally get to
                share what I like to or currently do.
            </li>
        </ul></p>
